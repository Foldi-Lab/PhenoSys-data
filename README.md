## Steps from start to finish for the pose estimation and behavioural clustering analysis in Huang-&-Milton-et-al-eLife-2022 üêÅ

### Overview

This repository contains the codes and steps used to analyse the pose estimation and behavioural clustering data and create figures for PhenoSys eLife 2022. <br>
The following files are also needed to follow these steps:
* The example import and export files folder.
* The DeepLabCut project folder, which is used to predict the locations of the rodent body parts over time.
* The B-SOiD project folder, which is used to predict the rodent behaviours over time.

Click [here](https://github.com/Foldi-Lab/PhenoSys-data/tree/main/Codes) to see the full steps for analysis and plotting.

### Installation

#### FFMPEG

Follow the steps [here](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-ffmpeg-on-windows/) to install FFMPEG. <br>
This is used for the video pre-processing.

#### R

Follow the steps [here](https://github.com/ETHZ-INS/DLCAnalyzer) to install the packages and DLCAnalyzer repository. <br>
I recommend using [RGui](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/base/) for the IDE.
This is used for generating the zone analysis results.

#### Python

Follow the steps below to install the packages needed to run these codes. <br>
Most of the analysis and plotting is done in Python. <br>
If you want to use the DeepLabCut and B-SOiD project folders, also install [DeepLabCut](https://github.com/DeepLabCut/DeepLabCut) and [B-SOiD](https://github.com/YttriLab/B-SOID).

Install [Anaconda Navigator](https://www.anaconda.com/products/distribution). <br>
Open Anaconda Prompt (on Mac open terminal and install X-Code when prompted). <br>
Download this repository to your home directory by typing in the line below.
```
git clone https://github.com/Foldi-Lab/PhenoSys-data.git
```
Change the directory to the place where the downloaded folder is. <br>
```
cd PhenoSys-data
```

Create a conda environment and install the dependencies.
```
conda env create -n PSD -f Python_dependencies.yaml
```

Close, reopen anaconda prompt and change the directory to the place where the codes are.
```
cd PhenoSys-data/Codes
```

Activate the conda environment.
```
conda activate PSD
```

Edit and run whichever codes you want to.
```
python Step_5_Prepare_zone_data_for_analysis.py
python Step_7_Add_row_info.py
python Step_8_Prepare_tracking_data_for_behavioural_clustering.py
python Step_10_Prepare_behavioural_data_for_plotting.py
python Step_11_Create_spider_plots_and_time_bin_heatmaps.py
```
